Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?

Explain the entire java life cycle.
Ans: On an editor (like Eclipse), we write our codes which will be compiled in a compiler (Javac), to java bytecodes.
The Java Virtual Machine runs this bytecodes --> result(operating system).

what is class?
Ans : A class is a template of Java that specify the creation and behavior of its instances(objects).

What is object?
Ans : An object is an instance of a class.

What is the entry point of an application?
Ans : It is where we execute the first instruction of application. it's Public Static Void main (String [] args{}.

Why main is static?
Ans : Since the main method is the starting point from where compiler starts program execution, it should be able to be
called without creating an object.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
Ans : Object class.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
Ans : Classpath --> specifies the location of pre-defined classes and packages.
Path --> define the location of executables files (.bin).

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
Ans : Abstract class --> It can have non-abstract methods. Variables can be non-static and non-final.
Interface --> The methods are abstract by default, and they cannot have implementations. Variables are static and final.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
Ans : No. --> create a subclass of this abstract class and implement it.

what is Access Specifier?
Ans : It's a keyword that defines how the elements of a class can be accessed like public, private, default, protected.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
Ans : Object Oriented Programming is a programming based on creating objects that contain both data and methods.
Its features are:
*abstraction --> hiding data from the user, but not the functionality.
*encapsulation --> wrapping data with their methods in a single unit. We use setter and getter methods to set and get
the data in it
*inheritance --> acquiring the properties of class (methods and fields) into another class.
*polymorphism --> a process of relating classes to each other by inheritance.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
Ans : A Java package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes, interfaces, subpackages. java.lang package
is imported by default.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
Ans : Application Programming Interface is a interface that allows multiple software to talk to each other.

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
Ans : No, it doesn't. That is to avoid ambiguity because many classes could have the same methods display.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
Ans : Overloading allows a class to have many methods with the same name but with different parameters.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
Ans :

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
Ans :static is used for a constant variable or a method that is same for every instance of a class. A static member
can be accessed without creating an object.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
Ans : Final is a keyword used to specify that a member can only be assigned once. A final variable have always the same
value. Final methods can't be overridden. Final class can't be inherited.

What is final, finally and finalize?
*Finally is a block which is used to guarantee that a program will be executed even if an exception is thrown.
*Finalize

What is a constructor ?
Ans : A constructor is a special method to initialize objects. It is called when an abject of a class is created.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
Ans : Yes, but they must not have the same parameters.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
Ans : default constructor.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
Ans : "this" is a reference variable that refers to the current object or instance.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
Ans : It is used to call superclass methods, and to access the superclass constructor.

What is JVM stand for ?
Ans : Java Virtual Machine is a set of software programs and data structures to execute other computer programs and
scripts. It converts Java bytecode into machines language, and then operating systems.

Is JVM platform independent?

distribution.

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
Ans : JDK --> Java Developer Kit : software development environment to develop java applications and applets. It
contains JVM and other libraries, files and development tools.
JVM --> Java Virtual Machine : environment to execute bytecode.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
Ans : JVM works inside a JRE with other files and libraries.

What is compile time and run time?
Ans : Compile time -->  time duration in which the programming code is converted to the machine code (Compile).
Run time --> when the program executes.
